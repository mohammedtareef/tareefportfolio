This portfolio website is a clean, responsive, and modern personal portfolio created using HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript. It serves as a professional digital profile for showcasing projects, skills, and contact information in a visually appealing layout. The design uses a dark-themed aesthetic with subtle gradients and smooth hover animations to enhance user experience, ensuring clarity and focus on the content.
The website is divided into multiple sections — Home, Projects, About, and Contact — providing seamless navigation through a fixed transparent navbar. The Home section introduces the developer with a strong personal statement, while the Projects section highlights completed works with attractive cards that feature titles, descriptions, and links. Each project card subtly animates on hover to grab attention and maintain interactivity, making it ideal for displaying real-time web or full-stack projects.
The About section presents a short biography and photo, emphasizing technical skills and personal interests to create a well-rounded professional image. The Contact section includes a responsive form allowing visitors to reach out easily. Overall, this portfolio demonstrates effective web design principles — minimalistic structure, responsive layout, and smooth transitions — making it an excellent template for developers who want to present their work and personality in a modern and engaging way.
